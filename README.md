# Keymap

Below is my current keymap for this board. There are 3 layers:

1. **Default layer**: QWERTY keys; equal & minus on the top-right; backspace for the left pinky (in place of the usual capslock); right main thumb is space; left main thumb switches to layer 1 (lower); right smaller thumb switches to layer 2 (raise).
2. **Lower layer**: Right hand arrow navigation plus common symbols (;|:~`\); F20-F23 send strings (controlled by karabiner elements); left hand lots of typical shortcuts, e.g. cut-copy-paste.
3. **Raise layer**: Right hand shift-arrow navigation for selecting text, F11 - F17 hotkeys for launching applications or finder (controlled by karabiner elements); right main thumb becomes Command; left hand has brackets, tab under the pointer finger, and a few other shortcuts.
